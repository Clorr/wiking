#summary Description of the Node Class

The Node class is the base class for all nodes in Wiking. 

A node is a data object accessed through an url, via the id parameter.

Nodes are stored as files or in a DB.

A call to a Wiking website requests the corresponding node, that is loaded and then, run.

Example: 
  * In a wiki, each (existing) page corresponds to a wikiNode instance. 
  * When requested, the node is loaded, instanciating a WikiNode object.
  * The WikiNode object, is then rendered.
  * The WikiNode object is programmed to support simple page rendering and editing.

  * If we create a new object called AdminNode for example, and that we store as the ":admin" node, then it will be possible to create an admin interface at that adress, the AdminNode handing all requests to the admin node and processing/showing each admin screens. 

= Virtual Nodes =
For the admin example we may find useful to have ":admin:panel1" URIs. In tha case, the system will not fnd the panel1 node, but, as it looks for parent nodes, will find the ":admin" node. This node wil then handle the requests.

Useful, for blogs, forums, search URIs

= Aliases =
It could be useful to handle aliases. Let's see how.... (aliases table ?)
