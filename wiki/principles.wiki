#summary Principles for the wiking framework

= Introduction =

Wiking is aimed at producing small sites. It is designed as a base to create sites with wiki, blog, forum capabilities as these kind of sites have common features. It is also designed for developers who create small sites for customers. 

= Features =

Wiking is primarly a framework. It means Wiking provides only the brick to build a site. It provides base elements to be used, and may be extensible. But unwanted features may be deactivated.

Key features are:
  * Clean URL : a usable web is based on urls that describe their content. Key principle is "one URL -> one content". 
  * Farming : Wiking should be installed once and used for as many sites as wanted, from static websites to multiple features websites. 
  * Node based : A wiki page, a blog post, a forum post may be considered as nodes. They will be primarly based on wiki syntax, but it may also use other formats.
  * Unobtrusive framework : separate folder for website and framework, so folders can use framework, or not.
